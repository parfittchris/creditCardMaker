### DESCRIPTION
This is a simple app that allows users to customize a credit card. Customizeable fields include Name, Credit Card Number, Expiration Date, and CVV code. Users input info in form element and see the changes updated live in the credit card sample image. Image fields are highlighted as they are being updated.

### CREATION
This app was created using the Create React App (https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It consists of one Class Component (Form) and one Functional Component(Card Image).

## Features
* Input fields include: Name, Card Number, Expiration Date and Year, and CVV Code. 
* Input field are highlighted on card image as they are being updated in form element.
* Number only fields forbid users from entering non-integer values.
* Updates occur in realtime as the form updates.

# Future Work
I'd like to add some animations to the rendering of the card. In addition, having a backside image and animating the card turn to see the back would be cool. I'd also like to potentially change the card based on whether it's a Visa, MasterCard, AMEX, etc.
